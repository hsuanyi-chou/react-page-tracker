# Getting Started

React Page Tracker uses the History API to track the current page position when the user clicks the back or forward buttons in the browser or clicks a link. It calculates the current page position to determine the user's actions. At the same time, it enhances the history's lack of tracking browsing history and how the user navigated to the current page.

You can visit the [demo](/demo) to see how it works.
